## 1. Motivation for a new course

Complex Big Data and Machine Learning (ML) applications and services and their reliability and robustness are strongly dependent on the underlying systems empowering such applications and services. On the one hand, techniques for supporting performance engineering, configuration management, testing and debugging of Big Data and ML are extremely important. On the other hand, large-scale distributed systems and new computing models  have been evolved with new hardware and infrastructure architectures, such as edge systems, tensor processing units,  and quantum  computing systems. Such systems and computing models are being exploited for advanced Big Data and ML applications and services. Developing and optimizing Big Data and ML applications and services in such systems and models require in-depth understanding of the systems and the roles of systems for Big Data and ML. Currently, we lack courses to deal with the above-mentioned issues, especially in-depth analysis and forward-looking research directions in (software) systems for Big Data and ML.  This course will study advanced topics in systems for big data and ML/AI.

## 2. Course connections

### Programme/major/minor/module course belongs to and connection to other courses:

The course is planned to belong to the [Doctoral Programme in Science](https://into.aalto.fi/display/endoctoralsci/Courses+offered) and the [CCIS Master Programme](https://into.aalto.fi/display/enccis/Computer+Science+%28CS%29+2018-2020), especially for *Big Data and Large-scale computing* track and *Software Systems and Technologies* track.

This course provides advanced knowledge about computing and software systems that are useful for big data and machine learning domains. Therefore, it connects to various other courses, such as *Big Data Platforms*, *Mobile Cloud Computing*, *Deep Learning* and *Master thesis*, by providing complementary in-depth knowledge w.r.t system aspects.

### Required previous knowledge/courses

Students should have knowledge about cloud computing, big data, operating systems, distributed systems and machine learning. Therefore, it is important that students have passed courses with these topics, such as *Mobile Cloud Computing*, *Big Data Platforms*, *Operating Systems*, and *Machine Learning*.


### Knowledge/skills offering to other courses

This course is an advanced one, aiming at supporting research topics in master theses and PhD studies. Therefore, it is not  a prerequisite for any course.



## 3. Content
*First*, key system requirements due to the complexity, reliability,  and robustness of Big Data and ML applications and services  will be analyzed and presented. Based on that we will learn techniques for supporting performance engineering, configuration management, testing and debugging of Big Data and ML. Such techniques are extremely important; they are **cross-topics** for the course, regardless of the underlying systems empowering Big Data and ML applications and services.

*Second*, selected areas in systems for Big Data and ML will be presented. For each selected area, we will examine the state-of-the-art, strengths and weakness of concepts and techniques. We will focus on engineering frameworks that can be used to development Big Data and ML, according to  the above-mentioned **cross-topics**.  The selected areas in 2020-2022 study plan will be:
* Dataflows/programming frameworks and orchestration techniques
* Edge systems and edge-cloud continuum systems
* New hardware architectures and quantum systems

**Cross-topics** in these selected areas will be studied. For each selected area, we will focus on the following aspects:
* understanding and applying key techniques and concepts
* analyzing/evaluating/creating (new) methods/techniques


### Focused Areas in 2020-2022

Advanced Topics in Systems for Big Data and ML will focus on the following areas:
*  Design and evaluation for systems robustness, reliability, resilience and elasticity for Big Data/ML (with also engineering work)
*  Test, debug, monitoring, and configuration management (with also engineering work)
*  Dataflows and Orchestration Frameworks for Big Data/ML (with also engineering work)
*  Edge systems and edge-cloud continuum for Big Data/ML (with also engineering work)
*  New hardware architectures and quantum systems for Big Data/ML (more on the concepts and state-of-the-art)



## 4. Intended learning outcomes

After this course students will be able to:
* classify and explain state of the art of systems requirements for big data and ML
* analyze and apply key metrics and system designs of Big Data/ML applications and services
* define and develop reliability, performance of systems for big data and ML
* apply and evaluate  key programming models and frameworks for Big Data/ML
* produce and evaluate edge system designs for Big Data and ML
* present and discuss new hardware architectures and quantum for Big Data/ML
* present and discuss future perspectives on systems for Big Data/ML


## 5. Teaching methods

This course will combine different teaching methods:

*  **Learning diaries**, and **Inquiring teaching**: in the first phase of the course, the teacher will outline key areas and possible problems. Students will discuss problems and will also suggest possible problems that the course should look.
* **Learning-by-doing** and **Project-based learning**: in the second phase, students will do practical works related a selected area and inquire state-of-the-art to identify a topic that they should work. After that the students will present the topic for discussion.
* **Project work**: in the last phase of the course, students will focus on a specific question that they will have to answer through the design, analysis, validation, or implementation work. Then they will present and demonstrate the results.

### Teaching sessions

* *Phase 1*: **4** teaching sessions for specific areas and **1** topic selecting discussion
* *Phase 2*: **4** sessions for presentations and discussions of selected topics from individual course participants
* *Phase 3*: **1** session for demonstration and discussion of project/creative works from individual course participants

### Examples of Assignment
A student is interested in quantum computing for AI, so the student might have
* Assignment: An individual topic for presenting state-of-the-art of quantum computing and quantum algorithms for AI. This will be based on reading and analyzing some selected works
* Project: since this area is still at an early stage development, the student might choose to develop a new conceptual idea and present the result of his/her idea

### Digital Tools

* [Mycourses](http://mycourses.aalto.fi): will be the main source where we will have lectures, surveys, topic discussions, project works and other materials.
* [Git Repository](https://version.aalto.fi): will be the place for code examples, hands-on tutorials, dataset, etc.
* Other cloud services for the course


## 6. Assessments

1| Individual participation and discussion in lectures (Phase 1 of teaching sessions)| Learning diary \& inquiry teaching| Study log and contributing topic identification| Pass with 50% positive
2| Individual participation and discussion in presentation sessions in Phase 2| Learning diary \& inqury teaching | Study log and assessment of other work|Pass with > 50% positive
3| individual study a selected topic and present a concept,  design principles, tools | Learning-by-doing \& project-based learning | A presentation of selected reading/topic to show the knowledge| Pass with > 50% positive
4|Individual/Group real-world mini project work on an open problem that presents insightful knowledge,best practices| Project work| Identify an open problem and present in-depth technical design, prototype and/evaluation| Pass with 50% positive, excellent if the result is novel.

A student will pass the course if the student has 4 passes and will pass with excellent if the project work leads to some novel results.
