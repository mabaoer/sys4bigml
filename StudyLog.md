# Writing and Evaluating Study/Learning Logs in CS-E4660
## Overview
In the course, students will have to write some study/learning logs, after lectures/hands-on sessions. This document provides a simple guideline about study logs for CS-E4660.

In CS-E4660, we interpret: *a study (learning) log is used to analyze what has been learned and to discuss relevant issues and thoughts identified through the study*

Therefore, we expect you to analyze important aspects and raise critical points that you think we should discuss and tackle, based on the study materials in connection with your individual interests/works. Writing a simple activities or listing topics you have learned are not a good indicator for this course.

## Expectation and Evaluation

|Study logs   | Fail              | Pass         |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
|Papers/topics studied| List papers/topics you learn/read   | Raise the most important, relevant topics you think and why|
|Knowledge learned| Just tell "I have learned a lot"  | Tell "I have learned a lot" because the knowledge you learned was missing/not covered from which perspectives|
|Tools studied  | Tools A, B and C can be used for big data/ML orchestration|  "I do not prefer any tool among Tools A,B and C, because I do not know them so I need time to investigate them" or "I think Tool A is much better than Tool B for ML because it is easy to use and supports many libraries"|
|Decision   | Just say "I plan to study topic A" | Tell the reason "I want to spend more time to study Topic A because ..."   |

A good way to write study logs is to give the reasons based on your understanding, expectation and decision, e.g.,

* *Among topics A,B and C, topic A is the most interesting one in my opinion because it helps ...*
* *I think that topic A needs to be discussed more detail w.r.t. aspect XYZ. The reason is ...*
* *I think that technique T1 can be applied into domain D1 to solve problem P1. The reason is*
* *I would like to apply technique T1 for my big data pipeline because ...*
* *I found another tool/paper which was not covered by the course but I think it is interesting because ...*
