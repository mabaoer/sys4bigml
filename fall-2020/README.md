### Hands-on tutorials
  - [Machine Learning experiment management](../tutorials/MLProjectManagement/)
  - [Observability and Monitoring](../tutorials/PerformanceMonitoring)
  - [Machine Learning Serving](../tutorials/MLServing)
  - [Edge ML Pipeline](../tutorials/edgemodelop)
  - [Qualty of Analytics for ML](../tutorials/qoa4ml)
  - [Common tasks with Edge ML](../tutorials/edgemlcommons)
### Project ideas presentations
  - Students will propose the project idea. This is an important aspect of *research-oriented course*. If a student cannot propose an idea, the teacher will suggest some concrete ideas for students.
### Final project demonstration
  - The final project demonstration should be organized like an "event" where all students can demonstrate their work and students can discuss experiences in their projects.
  - Demos:
    - [Chaos Engineering Data Validation](https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/kutluk1/chaos-engineering-data-validation)
    - [Elastic Image Search](https://github.com/anhnguyen1618/Image-search-demo)
