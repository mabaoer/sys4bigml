## Qualified prerequisites

ACCEPTANCE for joining the Course

pls. kindly check the course to see the format of the course (participation is required, study logs are required, individual topic selection/presentation and individual project are required).  Students are expected to contribute to the discussion of the selected topics and also bring the student's existing work (e.g., big data/ML samples in the student study) and use the work for doing the individual presentation/project (for implementing the ideas in the course) in the interest of the student. Every student will build his/her own story in the course, with the focus on selected areas/relevant problems we will discuss in the course.
